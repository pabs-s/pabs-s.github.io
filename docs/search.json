    "text": "Contrary to the headline, this is not a long-awaited eighth installment in the Chronicles of Narnia series. However, it is a story that audiences might find equally compelling—seeing which Big Ten offenses ran the highest average number of plays per game in the 2023 season and who is setting the tone this year.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'scales'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    discard\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    col_factor\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfblogs23 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://dwillis.github.io/sports-data-files/footballlogs23.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 1702 Columns: 54\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (8): HomeAway, Opponent, Result, TeamFull, TeamURL, Outcome, Team, Con...\ndbl  (45): Game, PassingCmp, PassingAtt, PassingPct, PassingYds, PassingTD, ...\ndate  (1): Date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nfblogs24 &lt;- read.csv(\"https://dwillis.github.io/sports-data-files/footballlogs24.csv\")\n\n\nLooking back to last year, there was virtually a three-way tie at the top of the Big Ten with the Penn State Nittany Lions leading Purdue and Wisconsin by the finest of margins. All three schools ran an average of 71 offensive plays per game. The next closest school, Illinois, ran nearly four fewer offensive plays per game across the same span.\nUnsurprisingly, the prolific punting Iowa Hawkeyes earned the lowest marks in this metric. However, this isn’t necessarily an indicator for success nor does it spell doom for teams lagging behind. Consider the fact that the national champion Michigan Wolverines, who ran roughly 61 plays per game, were only two spots ahead of the Hawkeyes. If an offense can be efficient and control the tempo of the game or a team can rely on a staunch defense to carry them, why bother running more plays at all? Food for thought.\n\n\nCode\nbigtenplays23 &lt;- fblogs23 |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\") |&gt;\n  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_plays = mean(OffensivePlays)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(avg_plays))\n\nggplot(data = bigtenplays23, aes(x = reorder(TeamFull, avg_plays), y = avg_plays)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Nittany Lions Brought the Pace in 2023\", \n    x = \"School\", \n    y = \"Average Offensive Plays Per Game\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch like the Pevensie kids stepping into the wardrobe, the 2024 Big Ten season sees a few new faces from out West in some very unfamiliar places. Former PAC-12 schools—USC, Oregon, UCLA and Washington—have joined the Big Ten ranks. Of those four schools, USC and Oregon haven’t waited for anyone to roll out the red carpet and already cemented themselves in the top three, averaging 71 and 70 offensive plays per game, respectively, through five games this season.\nThe bigger story here is that we have a new leader, the Maryland Terrapins, who are running an average of over 72 plays per game. Resisting the urge to name drop another classic tale, in this case involving a tortoise, we’ll have to keep an eye on the Terps throughout the year to see how sustainable this high-tempo offense is.\nIn terms of honorable mentions, Rutgers now finds itself in the top five with 68 plays per game, a six-play improvement from last season where it finished with the fourth-lowest amount in the conference. Nebraska and Iowa also deserve a shout as they’ve risen into the middle of the pack.\nFor not-so-honorable mentions, Purdue dropped nearly 18 plays per game and now sits at the bottom of the Big Ten in this metric. To put it in perspective, it’s generating almost six less plays per game than Iowa last year. It’s still early days, and we’d have to compare Iowa’s rate through five games last year to have a better idea of where Purdue actually is, but the West Lafayette side isn’t lighting it up at the moment. We’ll have to see how that story ends.\n\n\nCode\nbigtenplays24 &lt;- fblogs24 |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\") |&gt;\n  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_plays = mean(OffensivePlays)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(avg_plays))\n \nggplot(data = bigtenplays24, aes(x = reorder(TeamFull, avg_plays), y = avg_plays)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Speedy Terps Rolling with Top Average Off.

    "text": "Maryland’s 29-28 Homecoming win over USC isn’t the first time a Big Ten team emerged victorious despite accumulating less than 100 total rushing yards. In fact, it’s the ninth time it’s happened this year. And it could be indicative of a changing offensive philosophy in the Big Ten over the last three seasons.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(fb_tot_100_bigten, aes(x = Year, y = under_100_rush_pct)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Since 2021, the Big Ten is Relying Less on the Ground Game for Wins\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Total Wins\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(0, 12, by = 2),  \n    limits = c(0, 12)             \n  ) +\n scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(2011, 2024, by = 1) \n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing NCAA football game logs from 2011 to present day, I was able to visualize how often this phenomenon has occurred in the Big Ten. This process involved filtering the grouping the data by year, then adding more filters to isolate wins in games with the victors producing less than 100 yards and finally calculating the percentage of instances in which its happened in relation to the total number of regular games.\nSince 2021, the beloved (…or disdained depending on who you ask) grit-and-grind ground game Big Ten fans have become accustomed to could be changing as the number of games with victors producing less than 100 rushing yards has grown. Just past the halfway point in the season, Big Ten teams are three-quarters of the way to tying the highest winning percentage of the 2010s (almost 7% in 2019) in that regard.\nOver the last 14 Big Ten seasons, teams have played in just over 2,300 games and won 126 of them in that fashion—at a rate of nearly 5.5%. The 2021 season blew that average out of the water, basically doubling it. Big Ten teams are slightly off pace to match that season’s figures this year. However, it’s still very possible they will come close to matching or tying it considering there are five weeks left to play.\nTo contextualize this trend among the entire college football landscape, I followed the same process. The result? Across 21,592 games over the same time period, teams won 4.95% of games (or 1,069 for those counting) with less than 100 rushing yards. That’s not crazy. However, what is noteworthy is the fact that the national percentage in 2021 was roughly 6.4% in comparison to the Big’s 10.5% figure.\nIt’s going to take a wait-and-see approach to find out how this season plays out and whether the Big Ten truly is embracing the passing game even more than before."
